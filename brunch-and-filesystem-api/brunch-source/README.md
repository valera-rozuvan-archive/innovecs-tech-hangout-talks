To build, you need [node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node), and [brunch](https://github.com/brunch/brunch). Then use

    $ npm install
    $ brunch build

The results can be found in the __public/__ directory.

If you are lazy, you can browse the [latest build](https://github.com/valera-rozuvan/Tech-Hangout/tree/master/brunch-and-filesystem-api/).
